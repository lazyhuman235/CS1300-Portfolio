        <h2> Overview</h2>
        <h5>This is React based webpage for a Bakery. This webpage is list-based interface
          that allows users to add or remove various bakery items from the shopping cart and aggregates them to
        to provide a list of all the products added along with the total price. 
        

        <br><br>
        <h2>More about the Application</h2>

        This application consists of 15 different items which are displayed in list-based format
        and user can add these items 
        to their shopping cart. There is a button which allows the user 
        to add a specific item from the menu to the cart. The cart displayes item name, quantity and price
        along with the cart total. The quantity for each item is increased everytime the Add to Cart button is 
        pressed.  

        <br><br>


        <h2>Technical Details</h2>
        The page is divided into three components: CartComponent, BakeryItem and BakeryCatalogue. 
        BakeryItem component takes care of the structing of information of a variant of an iPhone and 
        this is used by the BakeryCatalogue which also handles the functionality of the Add to Cart button. 
        The CartComponent takes care of all the activites of the Cart such as displaying item name, quantity and price of the items in the Cart
        as well as aggregates and displayes the total cart value. I used props to pass any data to any of the
        components. State changes are only triggered whenever the user adds or updates the quantity of an item which is 
        triggered whenever Add to Cart button is pressed.  

<br><br>
        
        This is how the end product looks like:<br><br>
        <img src="BakeryProject.png" width="50%" style='border:0.5px solid whitesmoke'>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>Usability Principles Considered</h2>
        - The page is effective (reaches the goal) and efficient (reaches the goal quickly).
        <br>- Terms, icons, and layouts all follow consistency and fit in together.
        <br>- Design and layout is comprehensible at first sight.
        <br>- User has the ability to complete their task and does not get lost, they have all the information they need to know at any time, in which part of the application they are in, which actions can be executed and how they are triggered.
        <br>- Web page reacts to the user’s input at any time and informs them about events actively.
