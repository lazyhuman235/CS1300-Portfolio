        <h2> Overview</h2>
        <h5>This is React based webpage which is a catalog for the new iPhone 14 pros. This webpage is a list-based interface
          that allows users to add or remove various iPhone configurations to their favorites list and aggregates them to
        to provide total amount of all variants in the favorites list. There is also a filtering and sorting functionality
        to allow user to control what configuration of iPhones they want to see.

        <br><br>
        <h2>More about the Application</h2>

        This website consists of 12 different variants of iPhone 14 pros which are displayed in list-based format
        and user can add these iPhones 
        to their favorites list. There are 3 storage options to choose from (128gb, 256gb, 512gb) and 
        4 different color options (Black, White, Gold, Purple). There is a button which allows the user 
        to add or remove that specific variant of iPhone to their favorites list. Adding to this list helps 
        the user understand the total amount the user might have to pay for all of the products in the favorites 
        list. There is a filter menu which enables users to filter products by storage and color options. 
        There is also a sorting feature to sort the iPhones by price.<br><br>


        <h2>Technical Details</h2>
        The page is divided into three components: Filter, Product and ProductList. 
        Product component takes care of the structing of information of a variant of an iPhone and 
        this is used by the ProductList which also handles the functionality of the favorites button. 
        The Filter component consist of the filtering activites and options that are available 
        (filter by storage, filter by color, sort by price), the Reset facility and also displays the 
        total price for all the items in favorites list. I used the concept of destructing and I destructured the 
        properties coming into our component into specific variables. State changes are primarily triggered on two 
        occasions by the user. The first one is tracking the state of the particular iphone variant to check if 
        it is being added or removed from the favorites list. The second one is tracking the state of all the 
        filter options available to the user to produce intended results.

        This is how the end product looks like:<br><br>

        <br>- Web page reacts to the user’s input at any time and informs them about events actively.
        <br>- All the components work as per instructions and page does not break
